- 👋 Hi, I’m NutShell
- 👀 I’m interested in wireless communication and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and the usage of some library.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the work of B5G or 6G if you are about to publish some relitive papers.
- I might contribute to it as well since I have published two IEEE conference papers and get two patent accepted.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can contact me through Email nutshell.stu@gmail.com or WeChat GlacierNuts.

Ps： All my code in github is free of use and it would be very nice of you to give me a little star.
